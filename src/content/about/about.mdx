Hi I’m Hai, a graduate from CoderAcademy Sydney Australia. I’m focused on Web development, working with HTML, CSS, Ruby, Rails, Javascript and the MERN stack, but will always open to learn new tech stack. I’m a focused and driven individual , with strong belief that technology can transform and make things easier, cheaper, more accessible for everyone.

I have always loved Math and Science , big fan of sci-fi and space travel movies. I enjoy having a good laugh at a stand up comedy show. I love cooking and have appreciation for different food and culture. I’m very passionate about sustainability , renewable energy , autonomy, and innovation that makes our world a better place.

If you share the same interests or have any inquiry don't hesitate to connect and have a chat with me.
